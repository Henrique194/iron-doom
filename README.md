# Iron Doom

Iron Doom is a Doom source port developed entirely in Rust, focusing on code readability and preserving the essence of
the original game. Built on the Chocolate Doom codebase, the project aims to stay true to the classic experience while
providing a modern, stable implementation. By addressing and fixing many of the bugs in the original engine, Iron Doom
offers a more robust version of Vanilla Doom, all while maintaining its authentic feel.
