/// Table used to implement a pseudorandom number generator.
///
/// The values in the table are the output from a linear congruential generator, one of the most
/// well-known algorithms for pseudorandom number generators. The multiplier and increment are
/// 134775813 and 1 respectively, which were used in the random number generators found in various
/// compilers from Borland in the late 80s/early 90s.
///
/// In pure mathematical terms the sequence can be calculated by the following formula (through the
/// closed-form sum of a geometric series), though for an implementation in software it is likely
/// to be impractical:
///
/// `a(n) = floor((134775813 ^ (n + 1) - 1) / 8832667615232) mod 2^8`
